<h1>The Best Movies According to Eric</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I like this movie because I like science and this movie makes me curious about the universe with all its theory</p>

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>I like this movie because at first it seems like a very light-hearted film, but the more you watch and observing the details, you start to see the tragedy</p>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>Even though this is not a movie, the story that is being written through out the anime is very intriguing that touches on many social problems of the world</p>
